# Classic Pong Game

## Description
The classic LED pong game, if you havenâ€™t played, consists of a paddle on either side of the screen. A ball will bounce between the paddles, and when it strikes a paddle it will bounce back towards the other paddle. Depending on how it strikes the paddle it will bounce in a different manner. If the paddle misses the ball, then the other player scores a point.

The classic pong game will be displayed on the LED matrix. The player can control their paddle using multiple buttons or the keypad. You can play against a basic AI, which uses a random number to determine at each movement whether it follows the ball or not. If the ball hits the center of the paddle it will bounce off the paddle continuing along the same X direction it was traveling in. If the ball hits the corner it will head in the opposite X direction.
